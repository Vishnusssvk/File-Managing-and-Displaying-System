The output snapshots for the described Flask application routes would include several key elements. The `/display` route would render a webpage showing a list of uploaded documents and images, each entry displaying details such as the ID, description, start date, end date, image thumbnail, and document link. The root (`/`) route would, on a GET request, display a form for uploading images and documents, including fields for file selection, description, start date, and end date, along with a submit button. On successful form submission via a POST request, a message such as "Document and image upload successful" would be displayed. For the `/delete_document/<document_id>` route, a successful deletion would return a JSON response with the message "Document deleted successfully," while a failure would indicate the document was not found or already deleted. The `/download/<document_id>` route would trigger a file download if successful, returning the document as a binary file with appropriate headers, and provide a JSON error message if the document is not found or an unsupported file type is encountered.
